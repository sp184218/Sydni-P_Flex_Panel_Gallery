# Film Panel Interactive Project ðŸŽ¬âœ¨

Welcome to my favorite project to date â€” a creative, interactive web experience that merges my love for *film* with the world of *web development*. This project is all about interactivity, aesthetic storytelling, and user engagement through video panels and sound.

## About the Project

This project features a *multi-panel layout* where each panel responds to user interaction. Some play sound when clicked, others reveal video after a thumbnail image. The visual theme is cinematic and immersive â€” inspired by the mood and movement of film itself.

Originally, each panel started with autoplaying videos, but that was quickly adjusted for a better user experience. Now, videos *only play with sound when clicked, and they **pause automatically* when you exit the panel. You can even *pause videos using the spacebar*!

Another huge design detail â€” the *background image stretches seamlessly across all panels* to look like one cohesive, cinematic frame. No broken edges, just smooth artistry.

## Features

- [x] Hover/click to reveal video interactions
- [x] Video plays sound only when panel is clicked

## Technologies Used

- *HTML5* â€“ structural base
- *CSS3* â€“ layout, flexbox panels, transitions
- *JavaScript* â€“ logic for interactivity, modal, video control
- *DropBox* â€“ for video hosting
- *Git & GitHub* â€“ version control and deployment

## Why This Project Matters to Me

This was the first project where I was able to truly incorporate my creative passions â€” especially *film* â€” into my code. Each line wasnâ€™t just technical; it told a story. It made me realize how much *user experience* matters when crafting something people will interact with.
